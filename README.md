# Breast Cancer Detection

This is a small machine learning project where I used **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not.  
The dataset used here is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model accuracy check with confusion matrix
- Making predictions on new data

# Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Numpy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Files in this Project
- logistic.ipynb → Jupyter notebook with all the code
- breast_cancer_data.csv → dataset file
- requirements.txt → list of libraries required

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Honeyghayal/breast-cancer-detection.git
